      Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

guidelines: |
  Read the specifications and generate the relevant Svelte components.
  
  You should generate the following files:
  - .svelte
  
  If needed, also generate .js and .css files.
  
  Make sure that the component is compatible with the existing codebase.
  Update the existing codebase to use the new component.
