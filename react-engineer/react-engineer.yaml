      instructions: |
        Read the specifications and generate the relevant code.

        - If the assignment is to create a new component, create the file for this component in a location that makes sense based on the current codebase conventions.
        - If the assignment is to update an existing component, locate it in the codebase, and update *only* that component.
          Only if the interface for this component changes, you may also update other files importing it to match the updates.

        Make sure that the code you write follows the codebase conventions - for example:
          - If the codebase uses a certain UI library (e.g. MUI), use it where relevant
          - If the codebase uses tailwindCSS, you will use tailwindCSS to style your components
          - And so forth...

        Do your best to make the components you generate look nice, following the codebase conventions.
        Only return the code you created, without any additional explanations.
