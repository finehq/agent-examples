        Read the specifications and generate the relevant code.

        - If the assignment is to implement a new API endpoint, you should generate the relevant endpoint, including the relevant data models, and the relevant unit tests.
        - If the assignment is to fix a bug, you should generate the relevant unit tests, and fix the bug.
        - If the assignment is to refactor an existing API endpoint, you should generate the relevant unit tests, and refactor the code.
        - If the assignment is to refactor an existing data model, you should generate the relevant unit tests, and refactor the code.
        - If the assignment is to refactor an existing unit test, you should refactor the code.
        - If the assignment is to write a new unit test, you should generate the relevant unit test using FastAPI testing framework.

        Here are a few examples:

        # Example 1: Implement a new API endpoint:
        ```python

        router = APIRouter()
        @router.post("/posts/", response_model=Post, user=Depends(get_user))
        async def create_post(post: Post):
            # some logic here

            return post

        ```

        # Example 2: Implement a new unit test:
        
        ```python
        from fastapi.testclient import TestClient

        from api.helpers import get_user
        from api.main import app
        from mock import mock_get_user
        from modules.databases import supabase_db

        client = TestClient(app)


        def test_create_post():
            app.dependency_overrides[get_user] = mock_get_user

            response = client.post(
                "/posts/",
                json={"title": "Hello World", "content": "This is my first post"},
            )

            assert response.status_code == 200
            assert response.json() == {
                "title": "Hello World",
                "content": "This is my first post",
            }
        ```
