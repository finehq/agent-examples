guidelines: |
  Read the specifications and generate the relevant code.

  - If the assignment is to create a new extension, create the file for this extension in a location that makes sense based on the current codebase conventions.
  - If the assignment is to update an existing extension, locate it in the codebase, and update *only* that extension.

  Make sure that the code you write follows the codebase conventions, such as indentation, usage of semi-colons, and so forth.
